# AngularJS Interview Problem Set

## Background

This app implements a simple tabbed to-do list. A list of todo
items is an array of objects with the keys:
name[string]
complete[bool]

## Problems

Implement the following features using only AngularJS. Do not
add 'id' elements to the HTML or use DOM selectors.

1. Add items and mark existing items as complete.
2. Tranfer items between tabs.
3. Create new tabs and name each tab.
4. The Angular service todoApi implements a simple mock api. Load
   data from the service and implement calls to the service api for
   updating changed items and creating new items.
